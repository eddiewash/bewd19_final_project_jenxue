This is Jenny's final project repo for BEWD 19 NYC


User Stories:

As an E-Spot user...

when I sign up and log in, I should see the home page, with a list of all the most recent public events, these events are created by other users and myself.

when I click on my name on the home page, I should see my own profile page, with a list of events that I created and events that I have RSVPed for.

when I add a new event, I should see the new event appear on the home page as well as my own page.

when I click into an event that I created, I should be able to edit my event or delete the event, and also see RSVPs.

when I click into an event created by another user, I should be able to see the detailed event page and RSVP.

when I click on the RSVP button for an event, a confirmation page should show up telling me that I've RSVPed for the event, and the event should show up on my profile.
